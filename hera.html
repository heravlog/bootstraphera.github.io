<p>MA MEMORIAL MODEL ACADEMY (MMMA) is located in Demra,Dhaka-1361 Idaho in the Big mmma.  Our school was constructed in 1992, and a 19,000 square foot addition was completed in 2004 another addition was completed in 2010. It included classrooms for World Languages and Choir and a complete remodel of  the Services classrooms and courtyard.  We currently serve 735 students, our enrollment has increased over 100 students in the last 7 years.  Our school is comprised of grades 6-8.

Our students start off their first WRMS year attending the Residential Outdoor Environmental School to kick off their transition to middle school.  The students experience many scientific and environmental investigations during the overnight outdoor experience.  Students are housed in cabins with teachers and high school student counselors.  This program is now in its 40th year.

Courses offered are Pre-AP Language Arts, Advanced Math up to Geometry, Foundational Math and Language Arts, and Study Hall classes. We also have an Intensive Reading Course called Read 180.

We also have a well-staffed student services team who serve English Language Learners (ELL) and students with special needs.  We have had excellent growth these past two years and are a Four (4) Star School - just missing five stars, the top rating, by three points in each year! We are a school with high expectations for both academics and student behavior.  At WRMS our number of discipline referrals & fights have decreased dramatically & students feel safe.

Our Mission Statement
MA MEMORIAL MODEL ACADEMY empowers students to embrace challenge, respect diversity, seek understanding, communicate effectively, and contribute positively to our changing world.</p>
